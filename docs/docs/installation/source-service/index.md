There are currently 2 options available for hosting the source code to your deployment. 

- AWS CodeCommit **recommended**
- GitHub

Both AWS CodeCommit and GitHub offer a git based code repository service which can be used to hold a copy of this project as your source including any customisations you apply. Both options offer the same level of functionality.
