This project can be deployed in multiple ways to fit your needs. The recommended approach is documented and highlighted in this installation guide. The recommend method is to utilise AWS CloudShell for the CLI commands and AWS CodeCommit for the git repository. However, this project will also work with your local CLI and GitHub as the git repository. If choosing not to follow the recommended method you are expected to understand how to convert any changes needed for your particular setup. 

[AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/) is a browser-based shell which provides you with many of the tools and permissions to complete the installation without needing to install and configure additional software or have CLI access to your local machine. 

[AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/) is a secure, highly scalable, fully managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories.
